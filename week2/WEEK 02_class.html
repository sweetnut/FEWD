	WEEK 02

tag = information of the content

DOCTYPE html = tells that we are using html

head = anything inside the head tag is not displaied to the user, info relevant (we link the css to that)

body = everything the user is going to see

inside body = A lot of terminology the way categorizes information

there is lots of tags that dont have closing tags e.g. img 

<a> anchor </a>

RELATIVE PATH 
<img src="../images/photo.jpg">  alt="My cutte image"

alt attribute is the added benefit of giving search engine more linguistic context about the image as it is used on your page


IMAGES
.png

limited number of colors: use .png
no transparency: use 8 bit png
with transparency: use 24 bit  png
if lots of colors: use jpg


CSS 

the last one is what is going to be read
